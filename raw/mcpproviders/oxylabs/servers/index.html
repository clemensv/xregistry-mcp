    "description": "The Oxylabs MCP server provides a bridge between AI models and the web. It enables them to scrape any URL, render JavaScript-heavy pages, extract and format content for AI use, bypass anti-scraping measures, and access geo-restricted web data from 195+ countries. This implementation leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a secure, standardized way for AI assistants to interact with web content.",
